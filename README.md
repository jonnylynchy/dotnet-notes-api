# Scratch Server / API
This is a simple notes-style application built in C# MVC .NET Core 2.1. It serves an API for a client for CRUD operations.

## Development
If you have the `dotnet cli` you can just enter `dotnet run` in the root of the project. If you open this in Visual Studio, you should just be able to run it.
